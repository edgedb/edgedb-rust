EdgeDB Rust Binding
===================

This workspace is a collection of Rust crates for EdgeDB support. Individual
docs can currently be found on docs.rs:

* [edgedb-tokio](https://docs.rs/edgedb-tokio) -- client for Tokio
* [edgedb-derive](https://docs.rs/edgedb-derive) -- derive macro for data
  structures fetched from the database
* Async-std bindings [edgedb-client](https://docs.rs/edgedb-client) (currently
  deprecated, and moved to CLI tool repository)


Running Tests
=============

Due to cargo's limitation on propagation of "features", tests can only be
run as few separate command-lines:
```
cargo test --workspace
cd edgedb-protocol; cargo test --no-default-features
```
